## My process

### Built with

- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- Structing html for easier styling
- Mobile first for easier responsive styling
- Changing all the fonts in a page by changing the font size of the body at a certain screen size

```css
@media screen and (min-width:1440px) {
    body {
        font-size: 16px;
    }
    .container {
        width: 384px;
    }
}
```

### Continued development

Spacing, growing proficient at Figma
